      "refined_text": "Certifying a PDF means approving its contents and specifying what changes are allowed for the document to remain certified. For example, a government agency creates a form with signature fields and certifies it, allowing users to only change form fields and sign the document. Removing pages or adding comments will result in losing the certified status. A certifying signature can only be applied if the PDF has no other signatures. These signatures can be visible or invisible, and a blue ribbon icon in the Signatures panel confirms a valid certifying signature. Adding a certifying digital signature requires a digital ID. Timestamp a document Acrobat allows users to add a document timestamp to a PDF without needing an identity- based signature. To timestamp a PDF, a timestamp server is needed. See how to  configure a timestamp server . A timestamp guarantees the authenticity and existence of a document at a specific time and complies with ETSI 102 778 PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures (PAdES) standard. Validate a digital signature If the signature status is unknown or unverified, manually validate it to identify the issue and find a potential solution. In case the signature status is invalid, you must contact the signer to resolve the issue. Validate all digital signatures 1.   Open the PDF for which you want to validate all digital signatures. 2.   From the global bar in the upper-left, select  All tools . 3.   From the  All tools  pane, select  Use a certificate  >  Validate all signature. 4.   Select  OK  in the confirmation dialog box. Once all the signatures are validated. You get a confirmation message. View previous versions of a digitally signed document Whenever a certificate is used to sign a document, a signed version of the PDF is created and saved along with the original PDF. The saved versions are in an append-only format, meaning the original PDF can’t be modified. The Signatures panel provides access to all digital signatures and their corresponding versions. To view previous versions, open the Signature panel and then select Options >  View Signed Version . The previous version opens as a new PDF, with the version information and the name of the signer in the title bar.  To return to the original document, choose the document name from the Windows® menu. Compare versions of a signed document After a document is signed, you can display a list of the changes made to the document after the last version. To compare the previous versions, open the S ignatures panel and then select the signature. Then, select Options >  Compare Signed Version To Current Version . Once you're done,  close the temporary document. Trust a signer’s certificate To trust a certificate, it must be added to the user's trusted identity list in the Trusted Identity Manager. Also, its trust level must be set manually. End users can exchange certificates or add them directly from signed documents and set their trust levels. However, enterprises may require employees to validate signatures without any manual intervention. Acrobat trusts all certificates that are signed and certified by a trust anchor. Therefore, administrators can preconfigure client installations or allow end users to add a trust anchor. Sign component PDFs and PDF Portfolios You can sign component PDFs within a PDF Portfolio, or sign the PDF Portfolio as a whole. Signing a component PDF locks the PDF for editing and secures its content. After signing all the component PDFs, you can sign the entire PDF Portfolio to finalize it. Alternatively, you can sign the PDF Portfolio as a whole to lock the content of all component PDFs simultaneously. • To sign a component PDF, see  Signing PDFs . The signed PDF is automatically saved to the PDF Portfolio. • To sign a PDF Portfolio as a whole, sign the cover sheet (View > Portfolio > Cover Sheet). Once you sign the PDF Portfolio as a whole, you can’t add signatures to the component documents. However, you can add more signatures to the cover sheet.

Note: Some situations require using particular digital IDs for signing. For example, a corporation or government agency can require individuals to use only digital IDs issued by that agency to sign official documents.  Inquire about the digital signature policies  of your organization to determine the appropriate source of your digital ID. • Get a digital ID from your own organization, buy a digital ID (see the Adobe website for security partners), or create a self-signed one. See  Create a self-signed digital ID . You can’t apply a certificate-based signature without a digital id. • Set the default signing method. • Create an appearance for your certificate-based signature.

To achieve this, all the necessary elements for signature validation must be embedded in the signed PDF. These elements can be embedded during the document signing process or added afterward. If certain information is not included in the PDF, the signature can only be validated for a limited time because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked. When a certificate expires, the issuing authority is no longer responsible for providing revocation status, rendering the signature unverifiable. The necessary elements for signature validity include the signing certificate chain, certificate revocation status, and possibly a timestamp. If these elements are embedded during signing, the signature can be validated without requiring external resources.

Consider signing up for  Adobe Acrobat Sign  online, the leader in  e-signatures  and web contracting. With Acrobat Sign, you can get PDF, Microsoft Word, and other documents sent, signed, and filed instantly. And best of all, Adobe hosts it securely, so your IT department doesn’t have to do the work of setting up a signature infrastructure. Resources Adobe Approved Trust List (AATL) : The Adobe Approved Trust List is a program that allows millions of users worldwide to create digital signatures that are trusted whenever the signed document is opened in Acrobat or Reader software. Check out the  current members . Adobe Security and Privacy Portal : A good first stop for all things security and privacy at Adobe. Certified Document Services : Certified Document Services (CDS) was the predecessor to the AATL. Content Security Library : Extensive documentation on Adobe certificate signature administration. Managing Digital IDs : Help pages for digital ID management. A  certificate-based signature , like a conventional handwritten signature, identifies the person signing a document. Unlike a handwritten signature, a certificate-based signature is difficult to forge because it contains encrypted information that is unique to the signer. It can be easily verified and informs recipients whether the document was modified after the signer initially signed it. To sign a document with a certificate-based signature, you must obtain a digital ID or create a self-signed digital ID in Acrobat or  Acrobat Reader . The digital ID contains a private key and a certificate with a public key, and more. The private key is used to create the certificate-based signature. The certificate is a credential that is automatically applied to the signed document. The signature is verified when recipients open the document. When you apply a certificate-based signature, Acrobat uses a hashing algorithm to generate a message digest, which it encrypts using your private key. Acrobat embeds the encrypted message digest in the PDF, certificate details, signature image, and a document version when signed.
