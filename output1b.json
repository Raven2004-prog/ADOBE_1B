To adjust the placement of your signature, hover over it until you see a plus icon, and then click and move the signature as desired. 3.   To adjust the size of your signature, hover over the blue circle at the corner and then hold and drag it as desired. Note: If you want to use an image as your signature or initials: • Sign your name in black ink on a clean, blank sheet of white paper. Sign in the middle of the paper so you don't photograph or scan the edges. • Photograph or scan your signature. If you are taking a picture of your signature, make sure that the page is lit and that no shadows fall across the signature. • Transfer the photo or scan to your computer. Acrobat/Reader accepts JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, TIF, and BMP files. You do not need to crop the image. Acrobat/Reader imports just the signature if the photo or scan is fairly clean. Fill in PDF Forms Is the form fillable? Not all forms are fillable. Sometimes form creators don’t convert their PDFs to interactive  fillable  forms. Or, they intentionally design a form that you can fill in only by hand or with the  Fill & Sign  tool. These non-interactive forms are called  flat  forms. Fill in interactive forms An  interactive  form contains fields that you can select or fill in. 1.   If necessary, select either the  Hand Tool  or the  Select Tool  from the context menu of the page (right-click on the page to open the context menu). The pointer changes to a different icon as you move it over a field. For example, the  Hand tool changes to an I-beam  when you can type text into the form field. Some text fields are dynamic, meaning that they automatically resize to accommodate the amount of data you enter and can span across pages.",

Streaming summaries for long PDFs When you use Generative summary to scan lengthy PDFs, Acrobat or Acrobat Reader processes the content in chunks and simultaneously streams summaries of the portions that it processes. It helps improve your productivity because you can instantly review the output and stay engaged. The key advantages of streaming summaries include: • Real-time streaming : As Acrobat or Acrobat Reader processes a lengthy PDF, it concurrently streams summaries for sections it has already analyzed. It helps eliminate any latency associated with summarizing voluminous content. • Segmented display : When you start generating the summary for your content, you'll immediately see summarized content for the sections that the Generative summary feature finished processing. • Parallel processing : While you engage with the summarized sections, the feature extracts headings, and generates summaries for the subsequent sections. Use generative AI features in meeting apps You can harness the power of generative AI features in Acrobat to gain insights from transcripts of online meetings in Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Use the generative AI features to summarize discussions or draft emails for meeting notes or action items.

      "refined_text": "For a list and explanation of each warning, see the  DigSig Admin Guide . XML data signatures Acrobat and Acrobat Reader support XML data signatures that are used to sign data in XML Forms Architectures (XFA) forms. The form author provides XML signing, validating, or clearing instructions for form events, such as button click, file save, or submit. XML data signatures conform to the W3C XML-Signature standard. Like PDF digital signatures, XML digital signatures ensure integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in documents. However, PDF signatures have multiple data verification states. Some states are called when a user alters the PDF-signed content. In contrast, XML signatures only have two data verification states, valid and invalid. The invalid state is called when a user alters the XML-signed content. Establish long-term signature validation Long-term signature validation allows you to verify the signature's validity long after the document was signed. To achieve this, all the necessary elements for signature validation must be embedded in the signed PDF. These elements can be embedded during the document signing process or added afterward. If certain information is not included in the PDF, the signature can only be validated for a limited time because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked. When a certificate expires, the issuing authority is no longer responsible for providing revocation status, rendering the signature unverifiable. The necessary elements for signature validity include the signing certificate chain, certificate revocation status, and possibly a timestamp. If these elements are embedded during signing, the signature can be validated without requiring external resources. Acrobat and Acrobat Reader can embed the necessary elements if available, and the PDF creator must enable usage rights for Acrobat Reader users by going to the hamburger menu     (Windows) or the  Acrobat  menu (macOS) >  Save as other  >  Acrobat Reader extended PDF . Note:  Embedding timestamp information requires an appropriately configured timestamp server. In addition, the signature validation time must be set to Secure Time by navigating to  Preferences  >  Security  >  Advanced Preferences  >  Verification  tab. CDS certificates can add verification information, such as revocation and timestamp into the document without requiring any configuration from the signer. However, the signer must be online to fetch the appropriate information.",

For documents that require certification, you must certify the documents before others sign them. If a document has already been signed, the Certify options are disabled. When you certify a document, you can control the types of changes other people can make. You can certify with or without displaying a signature. Signatures made with the  Certify  or  Digitally sign  options   comply with data protection standards specified by the  European Telecommunications Standards Institute  (ETSI). In addition, both signature types comply with the PDF Advanced Electronic Signature (PAdES) standard. Acrobat and Acrobat Reader provide an option to change the default signing format to a CAdES format. This option is compliant with Part 3 of the PAdES standard. The timestamp capability and native support for long-term validation of signatures (introduced in Acrobat 9.1) is in compliance with Part 4 of the PAdES standard. The default signing format, when set up accordingly, is compliant with Part 2 of the PAdES standard. You can change the default signing method or format, in the Signatures panel of the Preferences dialog box. Under Creation & Appearance, click More. Setting up certificate-based signatures You can expedite the signing process and optimize your results by making the following preparations in advance. Note: Some situations require using particular digital IDs for signing. For example, a corporation or government agency can require individuals to use only digital IDs issued by that agency to sign official documents.  Inquire about the digital signature policies  of your organization to determine the appropriate source of your digital ID. • Get a digital ID from your own organization, buy a digital ID (see the Adobe website for security partners), or create a self-signed one. See  Create a self-signed digital ID . You can’t apply a certificate-based signature without a digital id. • Set the default signing method. • Create an appearance for your certificate-based signature. (See  Create the signature appearance. ) • Use   the  Preview Document  mode to suppress any dynamic content that can alter the appearance of the document and mislead you into signing an unsuitable document. For information about using the  Preview Document  mode, see  Sign in Preview Document mode . • Review all the pages in a document before you sign.

In some cases, however, the signature field becomes locked after you sign it. Sign in preview mode for document integrity When document integrity is critical for your signature workflow, you can enable 'View documents in Preview mode', and then sign the document. This feature analyzes the document for content that may alter the look and feel of the document and suppresses such content to allow you to view and sign the document in a static and secure state. By signing in preview mode, you can f ind if the document contains: • Any dynamic content or external dependencies. • Any constructs such as form fields, multimedia, or JavaScript™ that may affect its look and feel. After reviewing the report, you can contact the author of the document about the problems listed in the report. Certify a PDF Certifying a PDF means approving its contents and specifying what changes are allowed for the document to remain certified. For example, a government agency creates a form with signature fields and certifies it, allowing users to only change form fields and sign the document. Removing pages or adding comments will result in losing the certified status. A certifying signature can only be applied if the PDF has no other signatures. These signatures can be visible or invisible, and a blue ribbon icon in the Signatures panel confirms a valid certifying signature. Adding a certifying digital signature requires a digital ID. Timestamp a document Acrobat allows users to add a document timestamp to a PDF without needing an identity- based signature. To timestamp a PDF, a timestamp server is needed. See how to  configure a timestamp server . A timestamp guarantees the authenticity and existence of a document at a specific time and complies with ETSI 102 778 PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures (PAdES) standard. Validate a digital signature If the signature status is unknown or unverified, manually validate it to identify the issue and find a potential solution.

Consider signing up for  Adobe Acrobat Sign  online, the leader in  e-signatures  and web contracting. With Acrobat Sign, you can get PDF, Microsoft Word, and other documents sent, signed, and filed instantly. And best of all, Adobe hosts it securely, so your IT department doesn’t have to do the work of setting up a signature infrastructure. Resources Adobe Approved Trust List (AATL) : The Adobe Approved Trust List is a program that allows millions of users worldwide to create digital signatures that are trusted whenever the signed document is opened in Acrobat or Reader software. Check out the  current members . Adobe Security and Privacy Portal : A good first stop for all things security and privacy at Adobe. Certified Document Services : Certified Document Services (CDS) was the predecessor to the AATL. Content Security Library : Extensive documentation on Adobe certificate signature administration. Managing Digital IDs : Help pages for digital ID management. A  certificate-based signature , like a conventional handwritten signature, identifies the person signing a document. Unlike a handwritten signature, a certificate-based signature is difficult to forge because it contains encrypted information that is unique to the signer. It can be easily verified and informs recipients whether the document was modified after the signer initially signed it. To sign a document with a certificate-based signature, you must obtain a digital ID or create a self-signed digital ID in Acrobat or  Acrobat Reader . The digital ID contains a private key and a certificate with a public key, and more. The private key is used to create the certificate-based",

      "refined_text": "Why use certificate signatures? Many business transactions, including financial, legal, and other regulated transactions, require high assurance when signing documents. When documents are distributed electronically, it's important that recipients can: • Verify document authenticity—confirming the identity of each person who signed the document • Verify document integrity—confirming that the document has not been altered in transit Certificate-based signatures provide both of these security services. Many businesses and governments have chosen to set up a certificate-based digital signature infrastructure within their organization. They use third-party certificate authorities to provide independent identity validation. Examples include: For instance, companies in the European Union who need to comply with advanced or qualified electronic signature requirements in  eIDAS e-signature regulation  or the  ETSI PAdES standard  (PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures). What can I do with certificate IDs? Once certificate-based digital IDs have been provided to end users, they can use  Acrobat  or  Acrobat Reader  software to sign PDF files and validate files they receive from others. Sign documents • Sign PDF files using certificate IDs • Place a signature box anywhere on the page • Add multiple signatures to a page • Add a time stamp to the document when working with a configured timestamp server • Certify a document with a visible or hidden signature so that recipients can verify authenticity with or without seeing a visible signature on the page • Automatically embed certificate data to support long-term validation Validate documents • Validate all signatures, confirming the identity of everyone who signed the document • Validate document integrity by tracking all previously signed versions of a document to verify changes made during the document’s lifecycle",
